                            let me tell you that you are not alone üòÑ. In this guide I will share with you, fellow developers
                            some tools and techniques I am trying to implement in my daily pro/private life, in order to keep everything
                            in place in my mind and body.

                        <p>
                            Personally, I think that the key to productivity  is good sleep.
                            Let me give you some reason on why you should give more attention to your sleep :
                            <ul className={'blog-ul'}>
                                <li>a good mental health</li>
                                <li>to be in a good mood during the day</li>
                                <li>to be MORE PRODUCTIVE.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>

                            Most of the developers I know are late-sleepers (me being the first üòÇ),
                            But these last days I educated myself a little bit more about how a good night of sleep
                            could improve your day... hm well... let's say YOUR LIFE.
                            I don't need to tell you then, that it is VITAL ü¶∫ if you want to crush your goals !
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        Here are some tips to improve the quality of your sleep (you'll see more <Link href={"#resources"} className={'underline font-bold'}>HERE</Link>)
                        <ul className={'blog-ul'}>
                            <li>Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily (this is my main problemüôÑ)</li>
                            <li>Engage in relaxing activities before bed (for example reading a book).</li>
                            <li>Avoid screens/bright lights an hour before sleeping.(fix a time where you won't touch anything)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br/>

                        The point is that if you find a good rythm with your sleep, you'll be will
                        more alert and ready to crush your goals all along the day.
                        I experienced it recently, I thought staying up late was a solution but in the long run it can
                        have great consequences on your health.

                            <li>Pomodoro Technique - Work in 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks. After four
                                intervals, take a longer break. This helps maintain focus and prevent burnout.
                            </li>
                            <li>Eat the Frog - Tackle your toughest task first. It‚Äôs easier to handle smaller tasks once
                                the most challenging ones are out of the way.
                            </li>
                            <li>Deep Work - Dedicate uninterrupted blocks of time to complex tasks. Eliminate
                                distractions and focus on producing high-quality results.
                            </li>
                            <li>Time Blocking - Schedule specific time slots for tasks to avoid overcommitting and
                                ensure a balanced workflow.
